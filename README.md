# Sentiment_Analysis_TweeBlob
This project is to fetch Tweets in real-time.
It uses 'Tweepy' and 'TextBlob'.
See, that's how I came up with the name, TweeBlob!
Tweepy is a Python package that provides a way to access the Twitter API with Python.
TextBlob is a Python library, used to process the Textual data.
