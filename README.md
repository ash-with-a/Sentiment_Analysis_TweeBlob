# Sentiment Analysis using TweeBlob
This project is to fetch Tweets in real-time.
It uses 'Tweepy' and 'TextBlob'.
See, that's how I came up with the name, TweeBlob!
Tweepy is a Python package that provides a way to access the Twitter API with Python.
TextBlob is a Python library, used to process the Textual data.
Here, the COVID-19 vaccination data is pulled from Twitter's feed.
Polarity and Subjectivity are displayed for each extracted Tweet.
After that, Sentiment/Emotion of each Tweet is shown saying 'Positive', 'Negative' or 'Neutral'.
